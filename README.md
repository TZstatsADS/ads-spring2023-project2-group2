# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

Term: Spring 2023

![screenshot](doc/figs/map.jpg)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on the work of a **NYC government agency/program** of your choice using NYC open data released on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website. In particular, many agencies have adjusted their work or rolled out new programs due to COVID, your app should provide ways for a user to explore quantiative measures of how covid has impacted daily life in NYC from different prospectives. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

+ **Project summary**: 
Collecting data from Mayor's Office of Climate and Sustainability, this application provides insight into how coronavirus impacted energy consumption in New York’s city in year 2018-2021. 
It also provides a comprehensive overview of how energy consumption in New York City changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and sheds light on the potential opportunities and challenges for achieving a more sustainable and resilient energy system in the future.

+ **Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) Chenbohan Zhang was responsible for completing the user interface (UI) of the home page.In the section dedicated to the heat map, Chenghao Lu submitted a well-constructed draft of the heat map code. Shengqi Cao improved the performance of the page's UI file, while Yuxin Liang organized and separated Chenghao's code into global.r and helperfunction.r files. In addition to this, Yuxin Liang also carried out the visualization of green energy usage in buildings over a four-year period. Furthermore, Chenbohan Zhang conducted time series analysis on energy consumption patterns during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Tianxiao He, on the other hand, was responsible for conducting regression analysis on energy consumption across various variables. Additionally, Tianxiao He designed the UI of the appendix page. Finally, Shengqi Cao deployed our project on the shinyapps.io for broader use. Chenyi Jiang is responsible for presenting the project.
